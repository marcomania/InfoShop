php artisan db:seed --class=ProductSeeder - if import needed
npm run build

upload the application without nodemodules 
make sure to keep template files in storage/app/public/templates folder [copy templates folder from the resources/views/templates]
remove hot file from public folder to avoid vite client, so it takes build folder
go to link-storage route to link the storage folder to public folder

add an .htaccess file in root folder

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
# That was ONLY to protect you from 500 errors
# if your server did not have mod_rewrite enabled

RewriteEngine On
# RewriteBase /
# NOT needed unless you're using mod_alias to redirect

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/public
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L]
# Direct all requests to /public folder

</IfModule>
